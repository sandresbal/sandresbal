### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sandresbal/sandresbal** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Silvia AndrÃ©s, current COO at [Fractal Media](https://fractalmedia.es).

Although my initial education can seem pretty far removed from the programming world (I have a Ph.D in Philosophy), I was specialized in Language, Logic and Science studies, which allowed me to get in close contact with areas such as artificial intelligence or natural language processing questions.

Additionaly, during the university years I took several voluntary courses on software related skills, as Linux management, and learned some Java and Scheme.

After starting my working life in marketing, I decided to take my interest in programming further and finished an Associateâ€™s degree in Web Development and I acquired some self-taught knowledge on mobile technologies, specially Android. 

Nowadays my work involves considerable technical skills, but rarely I have the opportunity to program something at work.

My repositories on Github involve some projects developed in the context of my studies, others are tools that can make my life easier at work or outside of it. 

Recently I started learning Python, which in comparision to Java (the first language I learned), is absolutely wonderful :heart_eyes:
